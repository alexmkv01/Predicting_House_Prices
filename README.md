# Predicting House Prices
Welcome to the Introduction to Machine Learning module coursework repository!

This project is a demonstration of the implementation of a neural network for regression. The goal is to develop and optimize a neural network architecture to predict the price of houses based on a given dataset (housing.csv).

In this project, you will find:

  - The source code for the neural network, including any necessary dependencies and instructions for running the code.
  - A report on the model, including a description of the model and justification of choices made, the evaluation setup, information about the hyperparameter search performed and resulting findings, and the final evaluation of the best model.
  - The Preprocessor method that preprocesses the input and output of the model, including handling of missing values, encoding of textual values, and normalization of numerical values.
  - The Constructor method that initializes the neural network model and all necessary attributes.
  - The Model-training method that trains the regressor model using forward and backward propagation, as well as an optional validation set for early stopping.
  - The Predict method that applies the trained model to make predictions on new data.
  - Libraries Used: Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Matplotlib.
  
I hope that this project will serve as a useful reference for those interested in implementing neural networks for regression tasks. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
